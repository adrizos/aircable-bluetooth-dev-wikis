# aircable-bluetooth-dev-wikis
This is a combination of development wikis, sample code, and tutorials that I have pieced together from the Google Code Archive site and many other locations in order to make the development and setup of AIRcable hardware devices easier during my internship at Nymbus Media. There is no single source of documentation for AirCable and any resources that are currently available are nearly impossible to find and are randomly spread out across the internet.

This may be helpful should you need to follow links that are referenced in pdfs etc.
