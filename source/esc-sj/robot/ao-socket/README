I took PDIS AO-SOCKET from http://pdis.hiit.fi/pdis/download/ and rebuilt
for PyS60 v2.0 (based on python 2.5), all the credit goes to them.

A blocking, thread-safe socket library for Python on Series 60.
See ../../pdis/pipe/blocking_socket.py for the main external interface.
Contains both native code and Python code. Probably the most important
bits to be found here are:

  * test-programs/ -- some test code that also, at least in some
    cases, provide decent examples on how to use the library

  * python-lib/ -- the "pure" Python code of the library

  * src/ -- C++ source for the native library code

  * binaries/ -- standard Symbian build files for building a SIS file
    from source, i.e. bld.inf, .mmp, and .pkg files; when building,
    choose the variants most appropriate for your SDK
