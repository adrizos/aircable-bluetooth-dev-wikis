Flexible logging facility

To use the built-in file logger, do this:

    from pdis.lib.logging import *

    init_logging(FileLogger("mylog.txt"))

If the specified file path is not absolute, it is relative to a
predefined base path.  On Symbian OS, this is "c:\logs\pdis".
On other systems, it is the current directory (".").

To actually enable logging, you must create the log file's directory
before running the application.

To implement custom logging functionality, provide a custom logger.
This only has to implement the write(text) and close() methods.

Calling close() is optional unless the particular logger requires it.
