This code is an advanced relay based on our simple relay code. 

Main difference with the base code is that this code will dumping to UART,
it will also wait for button press, when the button is pressed the device
will scan the air and pair again. It will also make use of 2 leds if those
are available.

Long button press will turn the device off.

For pairing this code uses name filtering.

If button is pressed while booting then the device will try to repair.
