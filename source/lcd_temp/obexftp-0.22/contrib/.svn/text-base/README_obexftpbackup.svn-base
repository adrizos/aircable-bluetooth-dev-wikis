------------- obexftpbackup 2.0 -------------

A while ago I wrote an obexftpbackup script which worked fine on the basic SE 
T610 file structure. Since upgrading to obexftp 0.18 I've had to modify 
the error checking, but more significantly I've had to completely re-write it 
to handle the directory structure of the SE K750i.

In its current form it will handle up to 8 levels of subdirectories and will 
accept file and directory names with spaces in them. There's also a sed line 
to handle filenames with apostrophes in them.

To use it simply create a directory called ~/Documents/Obexftp-backups, switch 
your phone's bluetooth to visible for the first run, then run obexftpbackup. 
On subsequent runs the phone can be hidden.

I've only found one bug so far, and that appears to be in obexftp itself when 
trying read the directory contents for the Pictures directory. I suspect this 
could be due to having over 100 jpegs in that folder.

Enjoy!
Ken.

The sleeps appear to be necessary to give my Sony Ericsson T610 a chance.

If you wish to retain all your previous downloads from the phone then
don't use the -o option, and take care to rename your pictures from the
default name otherwise Picture(1).jpg etc will omitted from your backup.
