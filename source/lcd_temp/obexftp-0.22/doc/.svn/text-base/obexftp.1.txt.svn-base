NAME
    obexftp - Mobile Equipment file transfer tool

SYNOPSIS
    obexftp [*OPTION*] [*COMMANDS*]

DESCRIPTION
    obexftp is used to access files on mobile equipment, i.e. cell phones.
    With obexftpd you can transfer files between any computers using IrDA,
    Bluetooth and TCP/IP.

    This tool lets you access the ObexFTP library by the means of a command
    line interface. You might consider using the other means available. E.g.
    the ObexFS filesystem for Linux.

OPTIONS
    The ordering of options is important. Every command will use the most
    recent device set. Every file without command switch will apply to the
    command given most recent. See EXAMPLES

  Transport Options
    -i, --irda
        Connect using the IrDA protocol. This is the default.

    -b *device*, --bluetooth *device*
        Connect to this bluetooth device. If the device is not given the
        first device found will be used.

    -B *number*, --channel *number*
        Use this bluetooth channel when connecting. The channel will be
        discoverd automatically if this option is not used.

    -d *no/address*, --hci *no/address*
        Use the bluetooth device referenced by number or address as source
        device for the connection.

    -u *intf no*, --usb *intf no*
        Connect to this usb interface or list all available usb interfaces.

    -t *device*, --tty *device*
        Connect to this tty device.

    -n *host*, --network *host*
        Connect to this network host.

  Compatibility Options
    -U *uuid*, --uuid *uuid*
        Select the UUID to connect with. Recognized values are currently
        "none" needed by some Nokia mobile devices, "FBS" (default) for the
        normal file browsing service, "IRMC" for IRMC synchronisation and
        "S45" when connecting to a Siemens Mobile phone via cable or "SHARP"
        for PCSOFTWARE UUID with Sharp devices.

    -H, --noconn
        Suppress connection IDs (i.e. send no connection header to the
        mobile).

    -S, --nopath
        Don't use "setpath" commands (i.e. send the whole path as filename
        to the mobile). Can be used together with --noconn and --uuid none
        to send an OBEX-PUSH.

  Setting The File Path
    -c *folder*, --chdir *folder*
        Set the mobiles current working directory.

    -C *folder*, --mkdir *folder*
        Set the mobiles current working directory. The folder will be
        created if it doesn't exist.

    -l *folder*, --list *folder*
        List a folder.

  Sending And Retrieving Files
    -o *path*, --output *path*
        Specify the target file name, overriding the implicit local name
        from --get or the implicit remote name from --put

    -g *source*, --get *source*
        Retrieve files from mobile.

    -G *source*, --getdelete *source*
        Retrieve files from mobile and delete them on the mobile

    -p *source*, --put *source*
        Send files to the mobile.

    -k *source*, --delete *source*
        Delete files from the mobile.

  Experimental Extras
    -X, --capability
        Retrieve the capability object from the mobile (if available).

        Probe and report device characteristics

    -x, --info
        Retrieve misc infos from mobile. I.e. memory size and free memory.
        Siemens specific for now.

    -m *src* *dest*, --move *src* *dest*
        Move (rename) files on the mobile. Siemens specific for now.

  Version Information And Help
    -v, --verbose
        Be verbose and give some additional infos.

    -V, --version
        Print version string and exit.

    -h, --help, --usage
        Print short usage instructions.

EXAMPLES
    To get the directory listing from the first irda device:
        obexftp -i -l or just obexftp -l as IrDA is the default.

    To get the file bar from directory foo from the first bluetooth device:
        obexftp -b -c foo -g bar

    To send the file bar to directory foo with device on first serial port:
        obexftp -t /dev/ttyS0 -c foo -p bar

    It is possible to use RfComm (serial port over bluetooth):
        obexftp -t /dev/rfcomm0 -c foo -p bar

    And also IrComm (serial port over IrDA):
        obexftp -t /dev/ircomm0 -c foo -p bar

    To send the file bar using plain OBEX PUSH:
        obexftp --bluetooth --nopath --noconn --uuid none --put bar
