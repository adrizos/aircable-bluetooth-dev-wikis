#*
TC1047 demo code. This sensor is included as part of every
new SensorSDK kit. This code will store it's readings and
will display both mV reading and Â°C estimate.


SensorSDK will store reading at $13, we store
our reading information at $10 and we display 
on line $11

reading update handler starts at line 510
reading display handler needs to start at
line 595

## for the TC1047
## we have: Vo=10mV/C * T + 500mV
## or: T = Vo / 10 - 50
## where Vo is in mV

## we'll store reading in $509
