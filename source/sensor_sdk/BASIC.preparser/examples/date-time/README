This example will show you how to read the date and time from a realtime counter
like DS1371 (included in the S.D.K. playground board) or others like the DS1372
compatible with DS1371, the AIRcable OS will read this IC over I2C and format the
seconds since 1/1/1970 as:YYYYMMDDTHHmmsst like 20060123T085854Z
where:
    YYYY is year in 4 digits form
    MM is month
    DD is day
    HH is hour
    mm is minute
    ss is seconds
    t is timezone (in this case Zulu which is GMT)

This example will cycle throug YY/MM/DD and HH/mm/ss t each 5 seconds.
