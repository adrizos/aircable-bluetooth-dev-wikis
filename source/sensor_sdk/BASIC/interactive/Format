WWXXYYZZMESSAGE
WW Hexadecimal level, 0 for root, always valid
XX Hexadecimal next level, valid only if action <> !!
YY Hexadecimal option pointer (from 0 to 19), valid only if action <> !!
	when user presses button, then menu from menu level XX, option
	YY will get shown first.
ZZ action, !! for child menu action, MESSAGE takes an special
	meaning in this case
	
for backward compatibility all lines have fixed length = 31 chars
If you need to extend to 32 chars you just don't add a line feed after each one
Line feeds are just \n as any UNIX system, \n\r from windows is not ok.
	
Each level can have up to 20 childs or system becames
too slow, still we don't recommend so many levels, it will
not be friendly for the user

A BACK menu option is not provided by the core code
but rather by the menu code to give way more flexibility

WARNING: There's no runtime check on the BASIC code, user code has
to do the check

Actions (in order of processing):
	!! browse next level
	HI send history
	ex exit menu
	
	
	More actions can be added if you need them
	Checks lines 770-789
