Changelog:
Version 0.6a:
    * Added Filtering Addr to Master.
    * Improved slave calls.
    * Improved command line even dispatcher.
    * Improved command line mode changer
    * Removed TIMEOUTS from command line.
    * Removed lots of BUGS $[SOMETHING] = $[SOMETHING'] doesn't assign chars

Version 0.6:
    * Taken code from UART version 0.6.
    * Changed UART reading for INPUTS.
    * Removed one line char reading.
    * Changed PRINTU for PRINTS.
    * Removed calls to uartint.
    * Add Security pin detection.
    * When the Command line is accessible then the device will get into a sort of
    	service slave mode, it will be discoverable, and will blink the leds only
	once with a longer period than the other modes.
    * Removed shell from the debug options, it's not needed any more, we can 
    	access to it from the command line instead.
    * Removed BT status from listing option.
    * Removed unnecesary sensors reading.
    * Made a function for the name part, to supress duplicated code.
    * Improved sensors code.
    * Added Power Switch.
    * Added Battery Measurment.
    * Removed LEDs from manual modes. Where making more problems than solutions.
    * Added command q for PIO settings.
    * PIO_IRQ strings are generated automatically based on PIO settings.
    * Manual Master now does LINK 3 instead of LINK 1.
    * Added Timeout with a little error checking to INPUTS. (This needs to be improved)
    * Moved SPP to main trunk.
    
    
Previous versions:
Version 0.1:
    * Moved from INPUTU and PRINTU to INPUTS and PRINTS
    * Removed Manual Modes
    * Removed PIO_IRQ
    * Removed DIP Switches measurment
    * Improved Service Master, now it really does: Inquiry, Connect, Inquiry,.. instead of Inqury, Connect, Connect,...
    * Added PIO_IRQ again, Command Line Switch ON must ensure that the command line is available, this also means getting the module into service slave mode.

Version 0.0:
    * Forked from Command Line Version 0.6a

From Command Line:

Version 0.6a:
    * Added support for Power Switch.
    * Added battery measurment support.

Version 0.5:
    * New Leds Schema: We moved from a two leds schema (Serial OS) to a 1 led
	schema (The rest of our devices).
    * New Security Framework realted to Obex/ObexFTP: Now there is a setting
	for directly turning OFF Obex/ObexFTP not just making it invisible,
	the user can turn on/off from the command line, and can also select
	the other old two modes Visible Always, Visible only at boot up.
    * Obex/ObexFTP Timing: Now the timing has been extended from a couple of
	seconds to 2 minutes, so when the device is first booted up, the user
	has up to 2 minutes to see the Obex/ObexFTP layer (only when the user
	has not choosen to turn it off)
	There is an extra feauture this timing is personalizable, so users can
	make the device fit they're solution.
    * Code Reorganization, some pieces of code had been moved arround using the
	new tool that can be found on the svn under the Tools TAG
    * Cable modes will boot up into unpaired mode in case it has timed out 
	before.
    * Added two different modes for Relay, Service and Cable, while one Service
	the device is always discoverable, on Cable mode the device is visible
	only for two minutes after each boot up.
