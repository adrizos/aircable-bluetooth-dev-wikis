	the user can turn on/off from the command line, and can also select
	the other old two modes Visible Always, Visible only at boot up.
    * Obex/ObexFTP Timing: Now the timing has been extended from a couple of
	seconds to 2 minutes, so when the device is first booted up, the user
	has up to 2 minutes to see the Obex/ObexFTP layer (only when the user
	has not choosen to turn it off)
	There is an extra feauture this timing is personalizable, so users can
	make the device fit they're solution.

	new tool that can be found on the svn under the Tools TAG
    * Cable modes will boot up into unpaired mode in case it has timed out

	only for two minutes after each boot up.
